# Leukemia Subtype Classification Using Multi-Cell Images

## Abstract

Blood cancer remains one of the most pressing concerns globally, and its means of diagnosis is still a challenge to this day. Current image-based research on blood cancer cells primarily focuses on single- cell images often neglecting the spatial features between multiple cells. Our aim is to train models for multi-classification task to classify leukemia subtypes using the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) dataset, which comprises a diverse collection of 3,256 multi-cell blood smear images classed according to their maturity subtypes. In this project, we also proposed a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture evaluated multiple machine learning models, including SVM, XGBoost, VGG16, DenseNet- 201, and ConvNeXt. We focused on optimizing accuracy while considering the misclassification costs associated with different leukemia stages, and found that ConvNeXt and DenseNet-201 pretrained model combined with our proposed architecture performs the best, with DenseNet-201 topping in performance across accuracy and having minimal misclassification costs.

##  Dataset

The models in this study will be using the archived dataset of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) blood cancer, which provides a large collection of 3,242 peripheral blood smear (PBS) images, organized into two subfolders where one contains the original images captured, and the other one pre-segmented. Within each of these two subfolders contains folders which hold images based on developmental subtypes: Benign, Early Pre-B, Pre-B, and Pro-B ALL. The dataset was prepared in the bone marrow laboratory of Taleqani Hospital in Tehran, Iran.
