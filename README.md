# Leukemia Subtype Classification Using Multi-Cell Images

## Abstract

Blood cancer remains one of the most pressing global health concerns, with diagnosis still posing significant challenges. Current image-based research on blood cancer cells primarily focuses on single-cell images, often overlooking spatial relationships between multiple cells.

This project aims to address that gap by training models for a multi-classification task to classify leukemia subtypes using the **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)** dataset. The dataset comprises **3,256** multi-cell blood smear images categorized by their maturity subtypes.

We proposed a novel **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including:

- SVM
- XGBoost
- VGG16
- DenseNet-201
- ConvNeXt

Our focus was on optimizing classification **accuracy** while also minimizing **misclassification costs** across different leukemia stages.

Key findings:
- **ConvNeXt** and **DenseNet-201** pretrained models, especially when combined with our proposed CNN architecture, showed the best performance.
- **DenseNet-201** achieved the highest overall accuracy with minimal misclassification costs.
